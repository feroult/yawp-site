# Guides

Welcome to the __YAWP!__ Guides! 

This documentation is organized into sections that can be accessed from the sidebar menu:

* The __Getting Started__ section takes you from the basic setup of the framework to an overview 
of its core concepts and motivations. 

* The __Tutorials__ section shows how __YAWP!__ works in practice.

* Finally, the __API__ section describes in deeper detail more advanced aspects of each of the framework's 
features.

Please [let us know](https://github.com/feroult/yawp/issues) about any information that you've missed.
